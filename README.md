# Hangman Game

This is a simple hangman game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player guesses letters to reveal a hidden word. After any incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. The game ends when the player guesses the word correctly or when the hangman is fully drawn (after 6 incorrect guesses).

## How to Play

2. Guess the letters of the hidden word.
3. For each correct guess, the corresponding letter(s) will be revealed in the word placeholders.
4. For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman will be drawn.
5. Guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn to win the game.
