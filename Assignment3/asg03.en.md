# Assignment 3: Yatzy Game (PHP)

Students will enhance their Yatzy game to have a PHP server
component for managing the scoring by using AJAX to
communicate between the HTML/CSS/JS client with the PHP server.

## Objectives

You will enhance your single-player
[Yatzy Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yatzy)
by adding a PHP server component to your `yatzy` GitHub code
repository based on your models built during the labs.

You will expose the Yatzy game functionality through a JSON API,
and update your JavaScript to make AJAX calls to your
newly created API.

All game state should be stored on the PHP server
(you can store that information in the [PHP $_SESSION](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.session.php))
and your HTML/CSS/JavaScript should focus on displaying
the current state of the game (the JavaScript should NOT calculate
scores or track progress, just display the current state).

You will track a game leaderboard showing
your top 10 scores.  For simplicity, this information can also be stored in
the [PHP $_SESSION](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.session.php).

## Deliverables

Consider keeping a copy of the original JS version (in `/versions/v01`)
of the game before making changing for this assignment.

You will submit all code in your `yatzy` GitHub code repository.
You will update your `README.md` to update how your game
works and screenshots of the various user interface states.

You will be graded on the following criteria.

| Mark | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 2.0 | HTML, CSS, JavaScript adaptation for server-side updates
| 2.0 | Quality of PHP Yatzy models
| 1.0 | Managing game state in PHP API Server
| 1.0 | Managing leaderboard in PHP API Server / models
| 1.0 | Intergation / updates of game into portfolio
| 1.0 | Overall quality of project deliverable (including git usage)

## Submission

Submit a summary of your delivery to BrightSpace before the deadline.
